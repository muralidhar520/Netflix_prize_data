# Netflix_prize_data

* This is the second big project that I worked on while learning ML.<br>
* Go through the exploratory data analysis, I've explained most of the things there.<br>
* Dataset taken from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data]<br>
* Test_matrixfactorization.ipynb file was created to test the matrix factorization algorithm on a sparse matrix [Algorithm consulted from: http://www.quuxlabs.com/blog/2010/09/matrix-factorization-a-simple-tutorial-and-implementation-in-python]
**Note:** The whole dataset was too big to fit in the main-memory, so I've performed all my task on the combine_data_1.txt file(from kaggle).
