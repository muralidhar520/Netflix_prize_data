# Netflix_prize_data

This is the second big project that I worked on while learning ML.<br>
Go through the exploratory data analysis, I've explained most of the things there.<br>
Dataset taken from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data]<br>
**Note:** The whole dataset was too big to fit in the main-memory, so I've performed all my task on the combine_data_1.txt file(from kaggle).
